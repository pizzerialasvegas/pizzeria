# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
```

No test suite is configured. TypeScript build errors are suppressed via `ignoreBuildErrors: true` in `next.config.mjs`.

## Architecture

This is a **Next.js App Router** single-page restaurant website (Pizzería Las Vegas, Guatemala) built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, and Shadcn/ui components.

### How the app works

The entire site is a single page (`app/page.tsx`) that renders different menu categories based on a React state variable. There is no multi-page routing — navigation tabs just update state to show the selected category.

**Data flow:**
1. All product/menu data lives in `lib/menu-data.ts` as typed arrays (`MenuCategory[]`, `MenuItem[]`, `ContactInfo`).
2. `app/page.tsx` holds `activeCategory` state and renders `<MenuSection>` with the matching data.
3. `components/header.tsx` emits category change events to control which section is shown.

### Key files

- `lib/menu-data.ts` — Single source of truth for all menu items, prices, descriptions, and contact info. **Edit this file to add/modify/remove products.**
- `app/page.tsx` — Home page with category state and layout orchestration.
- `app/layout.tsx` — Root layout: metadata, Google Fonts (Poppins), theme color.
- `components/menu-item-card.tsx` — Renders individual product cards with image, name, description, price.
- `components/menu-section.tsx` — Renders a full category section (grid of `MenuItemCard`).
- `components/header.tsx` — Sticky navigation with category tabs.
- `components/contact-section.tsx` — Contact/location info section.
- `components/footer.tsx` — Footer with "Desarrollado por RENOA" credit linking to renoa.tech. Contains commented-out `linear-gradient` styles pending client approval.

### Styling

- Tailwind CSS v4 (configured via `@tailwindcss/postcss`).
- Brand colors are CSS custom properties in `app/globals.css`: `--brand-red`, `--brand-blue`, `--brand-yellow`. There is also a `styles/globals.css` (legacy/duplicate).
- Shadcn/ui components live in `components/ui/` — these are generated files; prefer editing via the `shadcn` CLI rather than modifying directly.
- Path alias `@/` maps to the repo root.

### Images

Product images are stored in `public/images/`. The naming convention is `{category}-{number}.jpg` (e.g., `pizza-1.jpg`, `calzone-3.jpg`). Next.js Image optimization is disabled (`unoptimized: true`).
